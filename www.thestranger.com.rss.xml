&lt;p&gt;Eritrean-Italian filmmaker Gianfranco Rosi shot his fifth documentary, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/movies/24732361/fire-at-sea&quot;&gt;Fire at Sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Fuocoammare), with such care that it often feels more like a narrative feature than a nonfiction film (Rosi also served as cinematographer and sound man). Then again, there&#39;s something alien and strange about the rocky terrain of Lampedusa, an Italian island 70 kilometers from the African coast that has admitted more than 400,000 refugees. Like the Cuban exiles who have sunk beneath the waves while rafting toward the American dream, 15,000 refugees have perished over 20 years while attempting to cross the Strait of Sicily.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Just So We&#39;re Clear, Ohio, Banning Abortion at Six Weeks is Effectively Banning Abortion Completely</title>

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media2.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/18736023/1481232104-istock-517524426.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Unless you have a uterus!&quot; title=&quot;Unless you have a uterus!&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption-and-credit&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imageCaption&quot;&gt;Unless you have a uterus!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;imageCredit&quot;&gt;fotoguy22 / istock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, Ohio&#39;s state legislature made a conservative wet dream come true: They voted to ban abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/07/empowered-by-trump-ohio-legislature-pass-heartbeat-bill-that-would-ban-most-abortions/?utm_term=.fc882e02789f&quot;&gt;as early as six weeks into a pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;. Just so we&#39;re absolutely clear on this, banning abortion at six weeks is a disingenuous, scientifically absurd way to essentially ban abortion completely. It conveniently ignores the fact that many women &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/identities/2016/12/7/13875488/ohio-abortion-ban-heartbeat-six-weeks&quot;&gt;don&#39;t know they&#39;re pregnant that early&lt;/a&gt; and punishes them for that biological quirk. Oh yeah, and there&#39;s no exception for cases of rape or incest, because prescriptive, anti-choice cruelty evidently knows no bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There&#39;s plenty of trash model legislation bandied about by the hate groups* that want to cut off access to abortion&#x2014;there are the ones that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2006/10/misinformed-consent-medical-accuracy-state-developed-abortion-counseling-materials&quot;&gt;exaggerate the risks&lt;/a&gt; of abortion and require doctors to lie to their patients, the ones rooted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/study-sex-selective-abortion-bans-racist-asian-americans&quot;&gt;racist stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;, the ones that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2011/02/miscarriage-death-penalty-georgia&quot;&gt;criminalize miscarriage&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&#x2014;but what&#39;s so damaging about these so-called &quot;heartbeat&quot; bills is that they hide their real intent&#x2014;effectively outlawing abortion&#x2014;behind a cutesy affectation of concern for the fetal heartbeat, which conveniently happens to be detectable for (SURPRISE!) most of a pregnancy. Feigned concern distracts from the bill&#39;s abject cruelty, which is how most anti-choice legislation works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Trump&#39;s America. This is likely what it&#39;s going to look like when it comes to reproductive rights. We&#39;re going to see more extremists (again, that&#39;s what they are*) making &lt;em&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/em&gt; all but meaningless through deliberately misleading bills like this one. And that&#39;s not even taking into account the shitshow of the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio Governor John Kasich hasn&#39;t said whether or not he&#39;ll sign off on this law. But despite comparisons to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=john%20kasich%20%2B%20teddy%20bear&amp;src=typd&quot;&gt;teddy bear &lt;/a&gt;and being less awful than the racist baked potato-elect, his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/john-kasich-abortion-2016-campaign-218846&quot;&gt;record on abortion&lt;/a&gt; is bad enough to suggest that he will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when abortion is illegal, abortions still happen. So if you&#39;re advocating for an abortion ban like this one, you&#39;re advocating for an abortion-hostile environment that leads women to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2015/11/17/women-in-texas-are-inducing-their-abortions-themselves&quot;&gt;self-inducing&lt;/a&gt;, which is horrific and dangerous. I hate everything about this. If you do too, here&#39;s where you can donate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-great-northwest-hawaiian-islands&quot;&gt;Planned Parenthood NW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*I&#39;m calling them hate groups because they clearly hate women and some of them commit acts of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/sorry-gop-pretty-sure-terrorism-was-already-political/Content?oid=17084823&quot;&gt;domestic terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, and IDK for some reason I&#39;m just really into calling things what they are lately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        by Wm.&amp;#153; Steven Humphrey
          
          
          
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media2.fdncms.com/stranger/imager/u/large/24738308/1481234637-shutterstock_505591177.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;These kids are having the time of their lives. You know why? Because they are PREPARED.&quot; title=&quot;These kids are having the time of their lives. You know why? Because they are PREPARED. &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption-and-credit&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imageCaption&quot;&gt;These kids are having the time of their lives in the snow. You know why? Because they are PREPARED. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;imageCredit&quot;&gt;FamVeld/Shutterstock.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, snow is quickly approaching Seattle&#x2014;and what exactly are you doing about it? While worrywarts are rushing the local grocery stores for unneeded supplies, you should get your fucking priorities in order: &lt;strong&gt;WHAT&#39;S YOUR SLED SITUATION?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a sled in the garage, drop whatever useless thing you&#39;re doing right now and &lt;strong&gt;go and prep it&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&#39;ve thought ahead, you already have two sleds (like I do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Flexible Flyer sled with rails:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:500px&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media1.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/18735717/1481219190-screen_shot_2016-12-08_at_9.45.15_am.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen_Shot_2016-12-08_at_9.45.15_AM.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This style of sled is best in &lt;strong&gt;icy conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&#x2014;be sure to get an ordinary bar of soap and wax the rails to obtain maximum velocity. This sled also can be steered (which is a big plus), and ridden on one&#39;s butt or head-first (which many people advise against, but they are stupid and scared of life, so ignore them).&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A plastic or wooden toboggan-style sled:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:500px&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media2.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/original/18735718/1481219466-screen_shot_2016-12-08_at_9.50.40_am.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen_Shot_2016-12-08_at_9.50.40_AM.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sled is&lt;strong&gt; best for soft, snowy conditions &lt;/strong&gt;and won&#39;t get bogged down like Flexible Flyer might. It&#39;s fast as fuck, and even faster as fuck if you soap the bottom. Downside: Upon reaching top speeds, it will drift in any direction it prefers&#x2014;usually heading for the underside of a parked car, which will ultimately result in a broken hip and extended hospital stay. Don&#39;t think about that. Stick your hands in the snow at the rear of the sled to steer, kind of like how a kayaker uses their paddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON&#39;T HAVE ANY SLEDS?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, here are some less attractive substitutes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inner tubes&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvaM0DamT3k&quot;&gt;the death trap of sleds&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s how to make a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instructables.com/id/how-to-make-a-fast-sled-out-of-household-items/&quot;&gt;makeshift sled out of a cardboard box and garbage bag.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&#39;m a 37-year-old gay man who just got out of an abusive relationship. We were together five years, moved to Portland together, got married three years ago, yada, yada, yada. He suffered a traumatic injury earlier this year, which led to PTSD, which led to a nervous breakdown, which led to our savings being depleted, which led him to leave me in October. He moved back to the other side of the country, and I&#39;m broke and on my own in a strange city. I saw your dirty film festival when it played here, and it made me realize something: At my age, I should still be enjoying myself and evolving sexually. I was unhappy in my marriage for the last two years, but sexually I was unhappy for a long time. Recently, I had a decent one-night stand. It was a drunken, stoned hot mess, but it got the job done&#x2014;and there was no guilt on my part, which to me signifies that it really is over with my ex. But I can&#39;t help feeling like I&#39;m starting over. Not just dating, but starting over with my sex life and my writing. My ex had me switch from LGBT media&#x2014;which I am very good at&#x2014;to copywriting, which sucks but is &quot;steadier.&quot; The point is: I want so much sexually, because I&#39;ve been starved physically and psychologically, but I don&#39;t know where to begin. I feel like my marriage eviscerated me sexually. Not just the sex part of it, but the parts of my homosexuality that felt important to my personality, not just my turn-ons. Help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grieving And Yearning Man Asking Nicely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:700px&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media1.fdncms.com/stranger/imager/u/original/24738166/1481228090-1460574933-jsw_panel_1_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Seattle Globalist staffers Christina Twu (2nd from left) and Venice Buhain (4th from left) were on the panel for the first #JournalismSoWhite panel in April.

Buhain was also a panelist for a follow-up conversation in October.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;imageCredit&quot;&gt;ASK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seattleglobalist.com/&quot;&gt;The Seattle Globalist&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit online journalism outlet based out of the University of Washington&#39;s Seattle campus, has spent the last four years of reporting on Seattle&#39;s diverse neighborhoods and training writers across the city to report on their communities. (Full disclosure: I worked for The Seattle Globalist in the past.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because of looming university budget cuts, the news organization could disappear within a year. In September, UW officials announced that the school would no longer fund the Globalist come June 2017. The Globalist has since launched the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seattleglobalist.com/poweryourmedia&quot;&gt;#PowerYourMedia fundraising campaign&lt;/a&gt; to raise $5,000 in monthly subscribers by the end of December to keep their doors open.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since launching at the start of the month, the organization has raised $1,304.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss of funding came as a shock, said Sarah Stuteville, education director and co-founder of the Globalist. The organization had budgeted for having at least two more years of funding from UW, but budget cuts throughout the university cut that short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuteville and co-founders Jessica Partnow and Alex Stonehill also work in the UW Department of Communication as &quot;artists in residence,&quot; which includes teaching undergraduate- and graduate-level journalism classes part-time and mentoring students. The UW communication school, which pays for their teaching salaries, also suffered from the budget cuts. As a result, the trio&#39;s teaching hours will also be cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing that funding from the UW, which accounted for about 50 percent of the Globalist&#39;s budget, &quot;sent us into a crisis,&quot; said Stuteville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $5,000 monthly subscription, which the Globalist is trying to raise by the end of the month to stay afloat, would allow the organization to operate as a scaled-down version of the site, allowing them to retain at least one full-time editorial staffer, pay contributors and columnists, and continue educational programming for youth and the community, which is &quot;core to the role of the [organization],&quot; said Stuteville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted in this year&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/10/26/24652329/heres-what-you-missed-at-seattles-second-journalismsowhite-talk&quot;&gt;two #JournalismSoWhite discussions&lt;/a&gt;, writers of color face a number of barriers to entering the journalism field, including low wages and lack of opportunities. In response to this decades-old problem, the Globalist, seeks to train writers, many of who come from marginalized groups, to report on issues affecting their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That dedication to drawing in voices from across the community and commitment to teaching them the basics of storytelling is what drew Rituja Indapure to become a board member in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The variety of voices we get from The Seattle Globalist is so unique,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&#39;t feel like I find that diversity of voices in other media outlets in Seattle.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial problems arose over the summer when the Globalist was unable to renew grant funding for some of their programs, including a youth journalism apprenticeship. Two employees were subsequently let go. Since being notified of the UW budget cuts, the nonprofit have cut down their hours and  closed their satellite office at the Hillman City Collaboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The quality of our publication is only as strong as our ability to be out in the community offering people the opportunity to [learn to report] and doing media training to get their voices and issues onto our website,&quot; said Stuteville. &quot;We think of ourselves and our organization as a pipeline for creating more diverse journalism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School-wide budget cuts, to which the Globalist&#39;s loss of funding is tied, have also resulted in &quot;declining instructional funds&quot; for UW&#39;s Communication department, which resulted in fewer graduate and PhD student admissions to their programs this autumn, said David Domke, the Chair of the communications department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These are challenges we&#x2019;re doing our best to work through, to ensure that quality of teaching and research stay superb,&quot; he wrote in an e-mail. &quot;We&#x2019;re doing it, but economics are tight for all units at UW.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from UW&#39;s Office of Planning &amp; Budgeting did not return calls for comment on why the cuts were made by the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s happening to the Globalist isn&#39;t new. Many of Seattle&#39;s news publications are struggling. On Wednesday, The &lt;em&gt;Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/12/07/24737330/more-buyouts-and-possible-layoffs-are-coming-to-the-seattle-times&quot;&gt;announced more upcoming buyouts and layoffs&lt;/a&gt; this year. Today, NBC News announced it would &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekwire.com/2016/nbc-shutting-breaking-news-online-journalism-startup-acquired-2012/&quot;&gt;shut down Breaking News&lt;/a&gt;, which has offices in Seattle and New York, effective Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is terrifying news as Inauguration Day approaches for President-elect Donald Trump, who has already made alarming statements regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/trump-threatens-to-weaken-first-amendment-protections-for-reporters/&quot;&gt;weakening First Amendment rights for journalists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Given the larger conversations about where people can get good information and diverse information, especially in an era of Trump, the ecosystem and our constellation of community media is something [we need] to support and elevate,&quot; said Stuteville. &quot;This is a way to get through the tough times ahead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Lake has died. The vocalist and bass player for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2014/10/07/king-crimson-were-frippin-amazing-last-night-at-the-moore&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt; and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, both of whom helped to popularize progressive rock in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s (mostly) without compromising their lofty aesthetics, Lake passed away December 7 after a long battle with cancer. He was 69.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/up-and-coming/Content?oid=13669812&quot;&gt;Lake&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s grandiloquent, soothing voice contributed to making the first two King Crimson LPs&#x2014;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/never-heard-of-em-king-crimson/Content?oid=15808382&quot;&gt;In the Court of the Crimson King&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;In the Wake of Poseidon&lt;/em&gt;&#x2014;landmarks of richly textured, cerebral prog rock that still get much play in the homes of people with higher-than-average IQs. The eternally exciting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzAG2tj_a6A&quot;&gt;&quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&#x2014;which should be humanity&#39;s anthem until further notice&#x2014;was sampled in Kanye West&#39;s 2010 track &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp1mVNOB5tg&quot;&gt;&quot;Power&quot;. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lake left Crimson in 1970 to found ELP with Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer, a moved that lead to much greater commercial success than that of his previous group. While ELP have drawn knee-jerk disdain from prog-haters for decades, their catalog abounds with complex, beautiful, and at times demonically brilliant compositions. It may take a long attention span and an appreciation for classical-music flourishes ramrodded into a stadium-rock framework to enjoy, but the effort is worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his last years, Lake toured often under the &quot;Songs of a Lifetime&quot; rubric, recasting his phenomenal work with Crimson, ELP, and in his solo career while supplementing the music with storytelling and Q&amp;A sessions about his wild ride in the prog-rock trenches during the genre&#39;s zenith of popularity and creativity. At &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/greg-lake-emerson-lake-palmer-co-founder-dead-at-69-w454546&quot;&gt;Lake&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s peak, his voice, musicianship, and compositional prowess were all damn near definitive. Prog rock has lost another MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former ELP band mate Carl Palmer eulogized Lake on his website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is with great sadness that I must now say goodbye to my friend and fellow band-mate, Greg Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg&#39;s soaring voice and skill as a musician will be remembered by all who knew his music and recordings made with ELP and King Crimson. I have fond memories of those great years we had in the 1970s and many memorable shows we performed together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having lost Keith [Emerson] this year as well, has made this particularly hard for all of us. As Greg sang at the end of Pictures At An Exhibition, &quot;death is life.&quot; His music can now live forever in the hearts of all who loved him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So sorry to hear of Greg Lake&#x2019;s passing, a real legend.&lt;br /&gt;&#x2014; Tony Iommi (@tonyiommi) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tonyiommi/status/806931686130905089&quot;&gt;December 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <media:description>Greg Lake possessed perhaps the defnitive prog-rock vocal style: grandiloquent, affecting, and veddy British.</media:description>

    <title>Akio Takamori&#39;s Drawings and Sculptures of Men Apologizing</title>

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:700px&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media2.fdncms.com/stranger/imager/u/original/24729331/1480980098-img_8333_mag.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img_8333_mag.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption-and-credit&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;imageCredit&quot;&gt;Jen Graves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akio Takamori&#39;s doctor says the chemo isn&#39;t working and the cancer is untreatable. The last time we spoke, the Seattle artist was feverishly making work about what it means to apologize while also facing the realization that the last American president of his lifetime would be a man who never apologizes for anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late in the election, Takamori had begun to narrow in on a specific visual spectacle of our presidential politics: the isolated heads of the two nominees as they debated each other on TV. They were seen in boxes set side by side, so viewers could watch one react while the other spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Watching the debate, Hillary and Trump next to each other on the screen, I see the masculinity and the femininity harden into battlegrounds,&quot; is how Takamori described it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Rebirth of Gucci Mane: How Three Years in Prison Set the Trap God Free</title>

&lt;p&gt;Radric Davis. Mr. Zone 6. Trap God. GuWop. Inmate #65556019. Gucci Mane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, after a run of increasingly erratic behavior and incidents&#x2014;an epic, bridge-torching Twitter rant, fighting a fan in the mall, breaking a bottle over the head of a marine who wanted a picture&#x2014;East Atlanta&#39;s king found himself dropped from his label and headed to the Terre Haute high-security federal penitentiary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denied his freedom for three years&#x2014;a career-ending hiatus for some&#x2014;the Trap God gained some life-saving perspective on the things he&#39;d been taking for granted. The sentence also gave him a much-needed reprieve from his daily intake of weed and codeine. He focused on surviving this new environment and on strengthening the connection he had with his girlfriend, Keyshia Ka&#39;oir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time of his release&#x2014;in May of this year&#x2014;he&#39;d been clearheaded, clean, and getting lean for 30 months. His physical transformation&#x2014;six-pack and all&#x2014;was dramatic enough that there was god-honest speculation among fans that the man we were seeing was not Radric Davis, but a federal-government-engineered clone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carpool Karaoke with Madonna Seems Great Until She Makes Fun of Your Outfit</title>
    <link>http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/12/08/24738046/carpool-karaoke-with-madonna-seems-great-until-she-makes-fun-of-your-outfit</link>

&lt;p&gt;Singing along to Madonna in your car is pure joy. Singing along to Madonna in your car &lt;em&gt;with Madonna in the car&lt;/em&gt; seems like it would be a joy so pure as to be invisible, untouchable. You couldn&#39;t put your finger on it exactly, but you would feel, suddenly, more connected to the universe. At peace with yourself. Free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as we found out on last night&#39;s Carpool Karaoke with James Corden, singing along to Madonna &lt;em&gt;sans&lt;/em&gt; Madonna means that you don&#39;t have to deal with Madonna flouting seatbelt laws and negging on your shirt. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt;, having Madonna there means you also have Madonna to vogue with you, gossip about seducing Michael Jackson (with Chardonnay!), and entertain you by doing the splits out the window. Which is the better experience depends on how closely you connect your self-esteem to your &quot;very Seattle 1990s&quot; red flannel, which, make no mistake, Madonna hates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York Times Columnist Thomas Friedman Spoke at Town Hall About What the Internet Is Doing to Jobs and Culture</title>

&lt;p&gt;The three-time Pulitzer Prize winning &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; columnist was in town on Monday with his new book &lt;em&gt;Thank You for Being Late: An Optimist&#39;s Guide to Thriving in the Age of Accelerations&lt;/em&gt;. I haven&#39;t gotten a chance to read the book, but he had some interesting things to say, and I took notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the title of his book,&lt;/strong&gt; referencing the unexpected free time he&#39;s happy to enjoy whenever someone else is late. &quot;When you press the pause button on a computer, it stops. When you press the pause button on a human being, they start. They begin to reflect...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the year 2007.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The single greatest inflection point in technology since Guttenberg&#39;s printing press.&quot; That was the year Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, it was the year Facebook and Twitter went global, it was the first full year Google owned YouTube, it was the year three guys in San Francisco rented out their apartment on their way to founding AirBNB... and many other things he mentioned that I couldn&#39;t write down fast enough. &quot;And we all missed it because of 2008.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On thinking outside the box.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t think outside the box. I also don&#39;t think inside the box. I think without a box.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On his writing process.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;I take 11 months to write the book to find out what it&#39;s about. And then I take a month to rewrite it once I know what it&#39;s about.&quot; And then he starts showing it to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His metaphor for journalism.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;I&#39;m in the heating business or the lighting business.&quot; The &quot;heat&quot; is opinion/column writing, which is meant to provoke a reaction. The &quot;light&quot; is the newsgathering/informing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On journalism itself.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Good journalism in America has never been better, and bad journalism has never been worse.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the two-party system&lt;/strong&gt; in the U.S., which he believes has been strained beyond usefulness and is going to lead to the disintegration of the two major parties. &quot;And I personally won&#39;t miss them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the speed and scope of new technology. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;We have never been more Godlike as a species.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the reaction that he&#39;s &quot;naive&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; when he says young people need to be taught to practice the Golden Rule on social media. &quot;Na&#xEF;vet&#xE9; is the new realism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On how you scale&lt;/strong&gt; the Golden Rule in the age of the internet. &quot;Strong families and healthy communities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the backlash against globalism&lt;/strong&gt; as indicated by angry voters voting for Brexit, Trump, etc. &quot;I&#39;m also angry at the people who are angry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most prevalent disease&lt;/strong&gt; in the U.S., according to a doctor friend of Friedman&#39;s: &quot;The most prevalent disease in the country is isolation.&quot; And yet we are more &quot;connected&quot; than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did you know Town Hall takes video of some of their talks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://townhallseattle.org/event/thomas-friedman/&quot;&gt;posts them on their website?&lt;/a&gt; Town Hall is awesome. You can watch Thomas Friedman&#39;s entire appearance (though not the remarks he made at a reception downstairs before the event, some of which are quoted above) below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(The series began with Mr. in 2014 and continued in 2015 with Chiho Aoshima.) Each exhibition has been distinguished by not just being a prepackaged touring show but rather for including premieres of new works. Of the eight video installations in Tabaimo&#39;s Seattle show, she created four particularly for this exhibition. For inspiration, she used pieces in the museum&#39;s own personal collection, including the famous gold crows screens. The historical works are presented in a display adjacent to the new pieces in an exploration of the Japanese concept of &quot;utsushi&quot;&#x2014;the emulation of masterworks as a form of artistic education. &lt;b&gt;JEN GRAVES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        His Podcast with Jess Walter, A Tiny Sense of Accomplishment, Is Back!

So we doctored this basketball photo from his school yearbook.&quot; title=&quot;SHERMAN ALEXIE, PROM KING When 60 Minutes did a story about Alexie in the 1990s, they lost all of his high-school photos, including photos of Alexie as prom king.

&lt;p&gt;Sherman Alexie and Jess Walter&#39;s podcast, A Tiny Sense of Accomplishment, is a literary variety show that focuses on the messiness of writing. The two big-time, famous Spokanites (Alexie lives here, but that&#39;s where he&#39;s from) use in-progress chunks of their own short stories, first drafts of flash fiction, and little poems as jumping-off points for humorous but also meaningful conversations about the craft. They invite great writers on as guests (shout-out, Padgett Powell!) and also exceptional local musicians. It&#39;s the opposite of fussy, the opposite of pretentious, and no matter your level of writing experience, you&#39;d do well to fit the show into your tightly regimented podcast schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Seattle Arts News: Personnel Changes at OtB, PNB, TPS, OMG!</title>

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:700px&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media2.fdncms.com/stranger/imager/u/original/24737310/1481160718-dance_dance.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;In the arts the administrators come and go. Talking of Michelangelo.&quot; title=&quot;In the arts the administrators come and go. Talking of Michelangelo. &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption-and-credit&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imageCaption&quot;&gt;In the arts the administrators come and go. Talking of Michelangelo. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;imageCredit&quot;&gt;ANGELA STERLING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Sarah Wilke&#39;s move from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/10/20/24632688/siff-hires-sarah-wilke-as-new-executive-director&quot;&gt;managing director at On the Boards&lt;/a&gt; to the big boss executive director over at Seattle International Film Festival, OtB has shuffled around some of its top brass. Longtime artistic director Lane Czaplinski will maintain his job as artistic director, but he&#39;ll also be the CEO now. Betsey Brock used to be called &quot;the director of patron relations,&quot; but now she&#39;s called &quot;the director of external affairs.&quot; They&#39;re also currently looking to fill a new position called &quot;director of finance and operations.&quot; This trio will comprise OtB&#39;s newly conceived &quot;leadership team.&quot; So, if you&#39;re into arts admin and you know how to raise some money, it looks like OtB is looking for you.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In other news, as of November 30, 2016, executive director Karen Lane is &quot;no longer with&quot; Theatre Puget Sound. In press materials, board president Karen Lund has nothing but good things to say: &quot;We are extremely grateful for the seventeen years of service provided by Karen Lane, and we wish her nothing but success in her future endeavors.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of departures&#x2014;okay, the following people are not arts administrators, but they&#39;re practically arts institutions in and of themselves. At the end of this season, Pacific Northwest Ballet is waving goodbye to two of its principal dancers: Carrie Imler, whose slo-mo promenade during &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/09/28/24583211/tricolore-at-pnb-athletic-french-minimal-to-the-max&quot;&gt;Tricolore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; this fall seemed to me to be a triumph of skill and strength; and Batkhurel Bold, who my colleague Jen Graves called a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/winking-at-ballet/Content?oid=101489&quot;&gt;&quot;noble powerhouse&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in PNB&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Dancing on the Front Porch of Heaven&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold the Bold:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkOijGdD6jo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And behold the Imler, whose aim is true: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/c-RBxdgacyA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Head of Seattle FBI Office Believes We Still Live in a &quot;Safe and Open Society&quot;</title>

      <description>
        
        by Alexis Myers
          
          
          
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media2.fdncms.com/stranger/imager/u/large/24737941/1481219187-special_agent_in_charge_jay_s._tabb.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Special_Agent_in_Charge_Jay_S._Tabb.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption-and-credit&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;imageCredit&quot;&gt;Alexis Myers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jay S. Tabb, Jr., the FBI&#x2019;s new Special Agent in Charge in Seattle, has the all qualities you&#x2019;d expect from a high-ranking federal law enforcement guy: a strong foundation in leadership he credits to his military roots (he served in the U.S. Marine Corps for more than seven years); a bureau career that began in 1997 and saw him working in counterterrorism, critical incident response, violent crime and drug trafficking; honorary recognition for his tenure with the FBI&#x2019;s Hostage Rescue Team (including the Medal of Valor and two FBI stars); and a direct, no-nonsense attitude paired with the self-assured confidence of a man who believes very, very firmly that he knows what he&#x2019;s doing&#x2014;and feels comfortable doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;I consider myself to be a very trust-oriented leader,&#x201D; Tabb said at a Tuesday press conference, where members of the Seattle Division leadership team gathered for Tabb&#x2019;s formal introduction. &#x201C;I am in favor of decentralized decision-making and centralized authority.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sharply dressed in a pinstriped navy suit and subdued red tie, graying hair neatly trimmed and ruddy face closely shaved, Tabb was a perfect portrait of FBI formality as he fielded questions regarding terrorism, immigration, hate crimes, the heroin epidemic and child exploitation (to name a few).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabb joined the Seattle Division in September, and in his short time here said he was most surprised by the number of child exploitation-related crimes&#x2014;&#x201C;child pornography, juvenile prostitution, etc. I had no idea the volume that we had here.&#x201D; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He admitted he didn&#x2019;t know why the area is such a hot spot for those particular crimes and wouldn&#x2019;t comment on the specific volume of cases the FBI is currently investigating, but he did mention the number of leads the FBI receives on those violations &#x201C;is not decreasing.&#x201D; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about hate crimes reportedly on the rise in Seattle following the election, Tabb claimed the FBI hadn&#x2019;t seen a spike here. &#x201C;I think there is mostly a slight uptick in hate crime reporting nationwide,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We take the allegations very, very seriously, but remember there is a difference between somebody&#x2019;s hate rhetoric and somebody actually committing a federal crime.&#x201D; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between fielding questions about dark subjects, Tabb revealed a good sense of humor, calling on it frequently and especially when responding to questions about President Elect Trump, though he kept his remarks brief, saying the Trump Administration should &#x201C;not really&#x201D; have an effect or impact on the FBI&#x2019;s ability to do its job but that it&#x2019;d be premature for him to comment on what would happen to the &quot;sanctuary&quot; of Seattle if D.C. decided to force inquiries about any and all persons&#x2019; immigration status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seemed to get uncomfortable when the questioning turned to white supremacists being in Seattle, recent protests and the appropriate time to use flash bangs, and was reluctant to answer queries about those topics&#x2014;but when the subjects of drugs, gangs and terrorism came up, Tabb seemed perfectly at ease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Trump administration and recent uses of tracking technology that can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/news/2016/09/28/24585899/how-the-seattle-police-secretlyand-illegallypurchased-a-tool-for-tracking-your-social-media-posts&quot;&gt;monitor social media feeds&lt;/a&gt;, there are heightened concerns about the use of surveillance by police and the FBI. But Tabb said the FBI isn&#x2019;t actively monitoring or tracking individuals online because they can&#x2019;t. &#x201C;We&#x2019;d have to have predicated investigations on individuals to monitor such things.&#x201D; Tabb said the FBI does work with social media companies on content flagging, however &#x2013; the protocol is to flag content, remove that individual&#x2019;s social media account, and pass the information along to law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burlington Mall shooting, in which the suspect Arcan Cetin killed people in September, which Tabb called &#x201C;a crime of passion, not a crime of terrorism,&#x201D; could&#x2019;ve been prevented if someone contacted the FBI directly about the suspect&#x2019;s behavior on social media. &#x201C;Some citizen saw those posts on Facebook and could have told anyone in law enforcement and potentially the outcome would be different.&#x201D; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabb said the now-old terrorism era catchphrase, &#x201C;if you see something, say something,&#x201D; still holds true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think we are any better or worse than anywhere else in the United States right now in terms of safety from terrorism,&#x201D; Tabb said. &#x201C;With that, though, I live in the same community, and I use the same public transit, and I go to the same malls, and I go to the same restaurants, and I do that with abandon because I do think we live in a very safe and open society still.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

This tax is completely original. It is the first of its kind. A tax on the class of people Trump is filling the swamp with. Indeed, we may see cities on the coasts becoming more and more progressive. In the shock of our situation, we see distinctly who and what we are. Right now, there&#39;s even a big push in San Francisco to decriminalize &lt;a href=&quot;http://endsexualexploitation.org/articles/california-amicus-brief-prostitution/&quot;&gt;prostitution in California&lt;/a&gt;. Under normal circumstances, it might not have had a chance; but we do not live in normal times. The president of rural America might be a New Yorker but he does not represent any of our urban values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing: The CEO tax was inspired by the work of the French economist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/piketty-gives-good-economics/Content?oid=19281392&quot;&gt;Thomas Piketty&lt;/a&gt;. The words of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes&quot;&gt;John Maynard Keynes&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Gerald Johnson, was the  board chair of the Committee for the Seattle Commons, a failed project that Dan Savage says Paul Allen should make up for by paying to lid I-5.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;imageCredit&quot;&gt;Christopher Boswell/Shutterstock.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Dan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x2019;ve read your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/features/2016/12/06/24731690/dan-savages-open-letter-to-paul-allen-on-lidding-i-5-righting-a-wrong-and-leaving-a-legacy&quot;&gt;open letter to Paul Allen about the Commons&lt;/a&gt;. I was the volunteer chair of the board of directors of the nonprofit that largely conceived and promoted the Commons proposal and certainly share your deep disappointment that we were not successful in persuading the public to approve the funding necessary to complete it. I do not share your view that Mr. Allen was in any way responsible for the project&#x2019;s failure. Or that he should have done more to achieve the vision.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;First the facts, most which you recalled correctly. Early in the project&#x2019;s development, we realized our proposal likely would increase the real or perceived value of properties located within the boundaries of the proposed park. We concluded that our ability to cost-effectively assemble the land we needed would be advantaged if we were able to control key parcels within important blocks, not only to buy as low as possible but also to frustrate increased valuation based on ownership or speculative assemblage of entire blocks. Of course, the nonprofit had nothing near the funds that would have been required to allow us to do that. Our largest benefactor to that point had contributed $1 million to pay for our environmental impact statement and there was a lot of daylight between the size of that gift and the rest of the contributions we raised. The City was unable to buy commercial property against the prospect that the park would succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We approached Mr. Allen for help in accomplishing this plan. As you explained in your open letter, he agreed to lend the nonprofit $20 million to acquire the key parcels, which served as collateral for the loan. He also agreed that if the project were able to proceed, that he would forgive the loan and effectively gift the properties to the City. If the project failed, he would take the properties and forgive the loan. To my knowledge, he then had no property holdings in or near the neighborhood. I don&#x2019;t believe that Vulcan Real Estate even existed at that time. Quite simply, he was not in the development business and wanted nothing more than for the park to proceed and to eventually make his gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voters were aware of this entire arrangement when we twice voted to reject the tax levies that would have funded the balance of the cost of the park, leaving no realistic scenarios for creating the park. After the second vote, with zero wind&#x2014;financial or political&#x2014;in our sails, we had no option except to fold the project. The properties we bought were then recovered by Mr. Allen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the Commons project was more than a park. It was a vision for all of South Lake Union that included high density, mixed income residential, as well as commercial redevelopment. It also included much of the surface street grid reconfiguration that is reflected in the Mercer corridor work that has now largely been completed. The long foreseen commercial redevelopment of the then relatively fallow South Lake Union neighborhood proceeded as we imagined it would&#x2014;which was the original reason we sought to anchor it with a big park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent and strategic location of the Allen holdings certainly enabled his future real estate company to undertake that inevitable redevelopment on an efficient and generally well planned basis. The neighborhood became the powerful economic engine that it is today more quickly and coherently than it would have otherwise. So that aspect of the Common&#x2019;s vision was realized beyond even our highest expectations. And the City was able to acquire the former Naval Reserve property from the Federal Government, creating Lake Union Park, the only part of the Commons park to be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, all of us who worked so hard to create the park continue to share your obviously deep and profound disappointment with the loss of what might have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of us share the notion that Paul Allen had anything other than best intentions in the role he played. He also is the person least to blame for the failure of the original vision. We have only ourselves to blame for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, with respect to your idea that Mr. Allen should now fund a new freeway lid park, a word of advice. As someone who frequently asks others for money for worthy stuff, I&#x2019;ve found that, generally, one shouldn&#x2019;t start a pitch with a beating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely yours,&lt;br /&gt;B. Gerald Johnson&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:700px&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media2.fdncms.com/stranger/imager/u/original/24732210/1481065013-bagge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;From Neat Stuff&quot; title=&quot;From Neat Stuff&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption-and-credit&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imageCaption&quot;&gt;From &lt;i&gt;Neat Stuff&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;imageCredit&quot;&gt;Peter Bagge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curve of the human spine as drawn by Peter Bagge may not correspond to the arc of the moral universe, but it does bend toward a certain kind of justice. Earlier this year, Fantagraphics published a deluxe, two-volume box of &lt;em&gt;Neat Stuff&lt;/em&gt;, the 1985 to 1988 comic book in which Bagge developed his signature style and voice, as well as inventing characters he would follow into his follow-up title, the better known and justly celebrated &lt;em&gt;Hate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Robert Crumb, Daniel Clowes, Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez, and a few others, Bagge was an essential mover in the evolution of comics from the somewhat shameful fixation of a cloistered, antisocial superminority to the weirdly acceptable semi-mainstream entertainment they represent today. A lot has happened since &lt;em&gt;Neat Stuff&lt;/em&gt;, but when Bagge looks back at the old strips it collects, he says the main question that comes to mind is &quot;What the heck was wrong with me?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Folks in Eastern Washington badly wanted to be a part of the Trump revolution, but they missed that history-making moment because Western Washington&#39;s huge urban population voted for Hillary Clinton. Even the suburb of Issaquah voted overwhelmingly for that nasty woman. The two state representatives behind this proposal, Matt Shea and Bob McCaslin, have even come up with a name for this Eden of idiocy. It will be called Liberty. Western Washington has, of course, no problem splitting with the other side of the state, but it definitely has a problem with Liberty gaining two seats in the Senate. Rural folks are already vastly over-represented at the federal level.  The vote of a man or woman in the sticks actually has more value than mine&#x2014;a man who will always belong to the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From a Conversation I Recently Had With a Local Novelist:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;While driving through Eastern Washington [aka Liberty], I actually heard on the radio an exorcism. I just could not believe it. A preacher, on air, was trying to get a demon out of some poor woman. It really is another world out there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That Stuff Seattle Cannot Handle Might Fall Today:&lt;/strong&gt; Even a little snow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/forecast-prepare-for-snow-to-hit-seattle-late-thursday-afternoon/&quot;&gt;shuts this city down&lt;/a&gt;. Other cities don&#39;t even think twice about two inches of snow (the amount that is expected to fall today), but we do; we get all nervous because our &lt;a href=&quot;http://mynorthwest.com/483956/northwest-drivers-testing/&quot;&gt;notoriously bad drivers&lt;/a&gt; become even worse in this kind of weather. Also, our buses get stuck and people are forced to walk through the freezing air. However, Link light rail, which is still breaking ridership records (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mynorthwest.com/483283/sound-transit-october-2015-and-2016/&quot;&gt;up 78.4 percent last month&lt;/a&gt;), is like an empire-era English gentleman, in the sense that it knows no weather. The trains can move through falling snow with the ease that they move through falling rain or the sun rays of a clear day. The good news is that our snow is expected to turn to rain on Friday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Sales in Vancouver B.C. Fell 37 Percent In November:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-04/vancouver-housing-tax-pushes-chinese-to-1-million-seattle-homes&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/a&gt; Everything points to the 15 percent tax imposed on foreign buyers this August. The decline in sales, however, has not yet translated into a fall in home prices. They are still way up there and expected to stay up there until sometime &lt;a href=&quot;B.C. Real Estate Association is predicting average home sales prices will drop by as much as 8.7 per cent next year in the Vancouver area and across B.C.&quot;&gt;next year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portland to Tax CEOs Who Earn Way More Money Than the Rank-And-File Employees in Their Firms:&lt;/strong&gt; The tax, which targets &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/12/steve_novicks_ceo_tax_wins_clo.html#incart_2box&quot;&gt;salaries at least 100 times higher than the salary of a median worker&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; is supposed to address income inequality caused by what is known as &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/aug/22/city-bonus-culture-bad-for-customers-the-economy-for-workers-neil-woodford&quot;&gt;bonus culture&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; The Portland City Council approved the plan, pushed primarily by Commissioner Steve Novick, in a 3-1 vote. This tax is completely original. It is the first of its kind. And it was inspired by the work of the French economist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/piketty-gives-good-economics/Content?oid=19281392&quot;&gt;Thomas Piketty&lt;/a&gt;. The words of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes&quot;&gt;John Maynard Keynes&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22-Year-Old Driver Smashes into 9-10 Cars on I-5:&lt;/strong&gt; Then he drove the wrong-way up the &lt;a href=&quot;http://komonews.com/news/local/hit-and-run-driver-goes-wrong-way-on-i-5-smashing-15-20-cars-before-being-caught&quot;&gt;Columbian Way&lt;/a&gt; ramp. Then he stopped his car. Then he began running to nowhere. The police found and arrested the young man near Airport Way South and South Horton Street (exactly where nowhere is). The police suspect the driver was disorganized by drugs.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obama&#39;s Team Is Alarmed By the General Slowness of Trump&#39;s Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Which has yet to fully understand that there are lots of little but very important details &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/donald-trump-transition-pace-concern-232334&quot;&gt;in the transition&lt;/a&gt; process. At present, Trump is all about the flashy and fun stuff, like nominating the former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon to run the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/tv/wwe-co-founder-linda-mcmahon-join-trump-cabinet-220759428.html&quot;&gt;Small Business Administration&lt;/a&gt;. Or nominating Hardee&#39;s/Carl&#39;s Jr. CEO Andy Puzder to be the next Labor Secretary. Puzder loves low wages and machines that replace low-wage workers.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our next Labor Secretary has said he wants to avoid higher wages by replacing the jobs in his stores with machines: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JW5ipwgdGt&quot;&gt;https://t.co/JW5ipwgdGt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/CyTLwlnstd&quot;&gt;https://t.co/CyTLwlnstd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x2014; Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/806889400382562304&quot;&gt;December 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The transition from Obama to Trump is like the transition from a universe with normal matter to one with bizarre matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Americans Can Say Christmas Again:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, you can stop dreaming of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rawstory.com/2016/12/watch-excitable-corey-lewandowski-tells-fox-news-audience-trump-ended-the-lefts-war-on-christmas/&quot;&gt;a white Christmas&lt;/a&gt;. Trump is here and you, dear rural white people, can have more whiteness in your Christmas than you ever dreamed of. But before you go all happy, let&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/film/2016/12/07/24732095/how-trump-turned-christmas-films-into-horror-films&quot;&gt;think about this&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We&#39;re now living in a world where the people of Bedford Falls have sided with nasty old Mr. Potter. Instead of banding together to bail George Bailey out of a jam with their nickels and dimes, they&#39;ve formed a lynch mob to string him up. Donald Trump has made Christmas movies into horror movies for anyone not born into the comforting illusions of white, small-town America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life Expectancy of Americans Declines For the First Time Since 1993:&lt;/strong&gt; It fell from &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2016/12/08/us-life-expectancy-declines-for-the-first-time-since-1993/&quot;&gt;78.9 in 2014 to 78.8 in 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; The heart is what kills most Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m crammed into a moss-covered hut with a handful of poets from the University of Washington&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/books/feature/2015/11/11/23132536/when-scientists-and-poets-study-together-the-world-gets-cooler&quot;&gt;poetry and science program&lt;/a&gt; at Friday Harbor, and we&#39;re all going googly-eyed and sparkle-brained over biologist Jenny Shrum. She&#39;s pointing at laminated maps, fiddling with improvised scientific instruments, and projecting infectious curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, Shrum has been working under the guidance of the island marble butterfly team to restore San Juan Island&#39;s population of the butterflies, an insect that scientists believed had gone extinct back in 1908, and which is now a candidate species for protection under the Endangered Species Act. There&#39;s only one population in the world, and they flutter about the tumble mustards and pepper plants on the island&#39;s harsh, windswept, ocean-beaten coastal prairie.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More Buyouts and Possible Layoffs Are Coming to the Seattle Times</title>

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media2.fdncms.com/stranger/imager/u/large/24737346/1481163945-slack_for_ios_upload_1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;We are into the bone, says one Seattle Times staffer. Every cut means news wont get covered.&quot; title=&quot;We are into the bone, says one Seattle Times staffer. Every cut means news wont get covered.&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption-and-credit&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imageCaption&quot;&gt;&quot;We are into the bone,&quot; says one &lt;em&gt;Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt; staffer. &quot;Every cut means news won&#39;t get covered.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;imageCredit&quot;&gt;The Stranger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what has become a &lt;a href=&quot;http://recoveringjournalist.typepad.com/recovering_journalist/files/newspaper_cuts.pdf&quot;&gt;grim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnwguild.org/news/seattle-times-layoffs&quot;&gt;holiday&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2016/01/09/23399099/fifteen-seattle-times-stafferssome-whove-been-there-for-decadeswill-leave-the-paper-after-buyouts&quot;&gt;tradition&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt; told staffers today it is offering buyouts ahead of expected layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s unclear how many positions will be cut and how many of those will be in the newsroom. In a memo to staff today, &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Alan Fisco said the paper will offer &quot;unaffiliated employees in certain departments&quot; buyouts over the next week and a half. (Read the full memo at the bottom of this post.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; In another email sent today, editor Don Shelton told the newsroom &quot;significant staff reductions are necessary&quot; and will be worse than the last round of cuts. Newsroom staffers should prepare for their jobs to change, he wrote. Read the full email at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After buyouts, the paper will determine how many layoffs are necessary. After a similar process last year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2016/01/09/23399099/fifteen-seattle-times-stafferssome-whove-been-there-for-decadeswill-leave-the-paper-after-buyouts&quot;&gt;15 &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; staffers&lt;/a&gt;, including some who had worked there for decades, left the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One staffer on the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; metro desk told &lt;em&gt;The Stranger&lt;/em&gt; today that more than a dozen people could be laid off. &quot;We are into the bone,&quot; the staffer said. &quot;Every cut means news won&#39;t get covered. I question how we can do it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the memo, Fisco wrote that the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; is &quot;forced to join the rest of the industry in adjusting to ever-lower advertising revenue. Industry advertising trends worsened in the second half of the year nationally. This trend is anticipated to continue for 2017.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the bright side,&quot; Fisco added, &quot;we continue to grow subscriber revenue which is key to the future.  Unfortunately, the increases aren&#x2019;t sufficient to offset structural advertising losses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the full memo sent to staff today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To: All Seattle Times Employees&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From: Alan Fisco&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Date: December 7, 2016&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Subject: Important Changes Coming&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As we all know, the newspaper/digital journalism and advertising business model continues to transform to the future.  While The Seattle Times has made excellent progress, we are forced to join the rest of the industry in adjusting to ever-lower advertising revenue.  Industry advertising trends worsened in the second half of the year nationally.  This trend is anticipated to continue for 2017. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, we continue to grow subscriber revenue which is key to the future.  Unfortunately, the increases aren&#x2019;t sufficient to offset structural advertising losses.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The purpose of this communication is to give you an update on our 2017 budget process and parking changes that are coming in early January. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As we are finalizing the 2017 budget, we need to realign expenses to our advertising revenue realities.   We know this is going to require difficult expense cuts, including staff reductions.  These actions, along with other operational changes, will allow us to continue our business model transformation journey and our mission of independent journalism and public service. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before we begin 2017, we are inviting unaffiliated employees in certain departments the opportunity to offer an Expression of Interest (EOI) in being considered for severance benefits in exchange for ending their employment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For affiliated employees in impacted areas, Reduction in Force (RIF) communications will go out in early January and we will follow the processes for reductions contained in your collective bargaining agreement, which in some cases include opportunities for volunteers to supplant those scheduled to be laid off.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Severance benefits&lt;br /&gt;&#xB7;         Unaffiliated full-time employees whose EOIs are accepted will be eligible for severance equal to one week of base pay per year of completed and continuous service with a minimum of 2 weeks and a maximum of 13 weeks. &lt;br /&gt;&#xB7;         Affected employees will receive regular pay for any accrued but unused vacation consistent with company policy.&lt;br /&gt;&#xB7;         Affected employees&#x2019; employer-sponsored medical and dental insurance coverage continues until the last day of the month in which their employment terminates.  Under&lt;br /&gt;a federal law known as COBRA, terminated employees are eligible to continue existing group medical and dental plan insurance for themselves, their spouse and/or any covered dependents at their own expense for up to eighteen months from the date employment terminates. &lt;br /&gt;&#xB7;         The Seattle Times will report to the Washington State Employment Security Department that your employment was terminated due to a Reduction in Force. &lt;br /&gt;The period to express interest begins tomorrow, and will conclude at Noon, December 19th.  If you are in a department offering EOIs, you will receive more information about the EOI from your department managers tomorrow, including a form to use if you choose to express interest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All offers of EOI will be handled confidentially with only those who need to know involved.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every effort will be made to accommodate expressions of interest, but we cannot guarantee that if you submit an expression of interest it will be accepted.  Based on the results of the EOI&#x2019;s, the extent of staff reductions necessary will be determined.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The last day of work for most impacted employees is scheduled to be February 3, 2017. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We appreciate the impact this action has to Times employees and their families.  We will strive to implement these changes in a way that honors the great work, and people who are impacted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For those of you who work here at 1000 Denny Building, we now have definitive news on the development of the parking lot across the street.   You will recall that we sold this property a few years ago to invest in our journalism and business model transformation.  This investment has enabled significant transformational progress. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In early January, the property owners will break ground on a major construction project.  During construction, the property owners are required to find alternative parking locations for us.  After lengthy negotiations, we agreed to be moved to parking located at 1220 Howell Street.  This is a relatively short walk, but for those who prefer, shuttle service will be provided every 15 minutes from 7 AM until Midnight, Monday - Friday.  This change will go into effect on January 1, 2017.  We anticipate new parking passes being available the week of December 19th.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please note, we will have fewer spaces during this transition time (anticipated to be at least 18 months).  We are attempting to secure additional parking at another location which is less than a block from the 1220 Howell parking.  However, even with these additional spots, we may not have enough parking spots available.  Because other lots do not offer the flexibility that we have, there may be significant changes or elimination of afternoon and weekend parking.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We hope to have more details for you, including specific start dates and plans for what parking is available in the next week. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thank you all for your patience, understanding and professionalism as we navigate these changes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Here&#39;s the email sent from editor Don Shelton to newsroom employees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To: News- All Employees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From: Don Shelton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Date: December 7, 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject: More on budget cuts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to follow up on Alan Fisco&#x2019;s memo about deep expense reductions throughout The Seattle Times in 2017. The newsroom will be sharing in those cuts, and they will be larger than in 2016. Managers around the newsroom are finalizing budgets and looking for other places to trim, but significant staff reductions are necessary. As painful as that will be, it is essential to keep The Seattle Time[s] healthy and continue our incredible legacy of strong, independent journalism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be very honest: The impact of these cuts will be significant. This will be a different newsroom next year, and every one of our jobs will change as we reduce staff and move ahead with changing our culture to become more digital, more nimble and more reader focused. And we must do that while protecting The Seattle Times&#x2019; brand and commitment to quality journalism and community service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will your job change? That&#x2019;s something for you, your editor and senior managers to determine, but it will change. I hope you&#x2019;re up for this challenge. All of us have to be pulling in the same direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#x2019;ll have an informal gathering in the fishbowl today at 4 p.m., and more formal question-and-answer sessions tomorrow in the fishbowl, 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. I&#x2019;m also available one-on-one. &lt;/p&gt;

        Uber&amp;#8217;s Anti-Union Scare Campaign May Be Working
          
            by Heidi Groover
          
          
          
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media2.fdncms.com/stranger/imager/u/large/24734532/1481145147-img_7752_copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Teamsters organizer Dawn Gearhart spoke during a hearing yesterday as anti-union drivers in the crowd held signs.&quot; title=&quot;Teamsters organizer Dawn Gearhart spoke during a hearing yesterday as anti-union drivers in the crowd held signs.&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption-and-credit&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imageCaption&quot;&gt;Teamsters organizer Dawn Gearhart spoke during a hearing yesterday as anti-union drivers in the crowd held signs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;imageCredit&quot;&gt;HG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this labor-friendly city, no organization can pack a City Hall meeting like a union. But, yesterday, the room was jammed for Uber, a multibillion dollar corporation. They were there for a hearing proposing rules on rideshare drivers unionizing.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The catch? Uber&#x2019;s crowd of drivers to say they don&#39;t want or need collective bargaining rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of three hours, those drivers, many wearing green &quot;I drive, I vote&quot; t-shirts and holding signs that said &quot;#EveryDriverCounts,&quot; nearly drowned out pro-union messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&#x2019;re already a union,&quot; one driver said. &quot;We don&#x2019;t need a union. We already have a voice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing was the latest action in an ongoing fight between Uber and the Teamsters union, with city officials caught in the middle. Although the Seattle City Council passed the law allowing drivers to unionize last year, they left important decisions, including who should be allowed to vote on joining a union, up to the city&#39;s Finance and Administrative Services Department. Uber has called for allowing all drivers to vote, no matter if they work one day a month or every day for eight hours a day.  The Teamsters union, which hopes to represent drivers if they organize, says all drivers should be allowed to vote, but the votes of those who drive full-time should be more heavily weighted. After yesterday&#x2019;s hearing, city staff may tweak their draft rules about who can vote. The rules must be in place by January 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:640px&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media1.fdncms.com/stranger/imager/u/original/24734522/1481144814-img_7736_copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Uber is advocating for all drivers, no matter how often or little they drive, to vote on whether to join a union.&quot; title=&quot;Uber is advocating for all drivers, no matter how often or little they drive, to vote on whether to join a union.&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption-and-credit&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imageCaption&quot;&gt;Uber is advocating for all drivers, no matter how often or little they drive, to vote on whether to join a union.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;imageCredit&quot;&gt;HG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law grew out of complaints from the app&#x2019;s drivers, who complained of low wages (less than $5 an hour in some cases), and intermittent and confusing deactivations, leaving them without work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Tuesday, anti-union drivers described making $15, $20, or $25 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Every ad I&#x2019;ve ever seen from Lyft and Uber,&quot; one part-time driver told the crowd, &quot;says, &#39;Make money in your spare time&#39; not &#39;Do this full time.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many of the drivers who&#39;ve advocated for a union in recent years say they&#xA0;do&#xA0;depend on apps like Uber and Lyft for their full income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a driver because I&#x2019;m bored at home,&quot; a pro-union driver said yesterday. &quot;I drive because this is my livelihood. This is what I do to care for my family.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drivers opposing unionization also expressed fears about union representatives harassing them to join.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t want some union representative knowing where I live,&quot; said Karen Whittle, who said she is a veteran who has been driving for Uber for about a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the hearing, the talking points from drivers who oppose unionizing also mirrored Uber&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/news/2016/12/07/24731875/can-uber-convince-its-drivers-they-dont-need-a-union&quot;&gt;ongoing&#xA0;anti-union ad campaign&lt;/a&gt;: They fear losing flexibility and worry a union might mandate when and where they can drive. Representatives for Uber say they fear the Teamsters union will try to negotiate a contract for drivers that requires a minimum wage, which would require the company to limit the number of drivers working at any one moment in order to ensure drivers&#39; wages. But in interviews, drivers who support unionizing and a representative for the Teamsters say their focus is on getting Uber to increase its rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much of the hearing was dominated by drivers who oppose unionizing, about an hour into the meeting, pro-union drivers spoke. When the Teamsters&#39; Dawn Gearhart took the mic, she told the room: &quot;Uber gamed the system because they have the money and the resources to do so.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearhart, showed up nearly three hours early for the hearing, says&#xA0;she saw Uber staff in line sign up for public comment, gather the numbers that secured them a place in line to speak, and then hand those numbers to other staff and drivers who showed up later. Gearhart also claimed Uber hired private security to monitor the line of people waiting to speak. &lt;del&gt;The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about these claims.&lt;/del&gt; (See below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For me it doesn&#39;t matter because I don&#39;t work for Uber,&quot; Gearhart said, &quot;but for the drivers who had to give up their hours [working] and their time to stand in the line... they gave that up to stand in line and have a chance to speak.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; In a statement Thursday, Uber spokesperson Nathan Hambley said: &quot;This is a transparent attempt to misdirect the conversation. The Teamsters were frustrated they couldn&#39;t control who got to speak or what was being said. They can&#39;t hide from the fact that the hearing clearly showed most drivers believe ALL drivers deserve an equal voice and vote.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/blabbermouth/2016/11/30/24721515/this-week-on-the-blabbermouth-podcast-jill-stein-and-demonocracy&quot;&gt;last week&#x2019;s show&lt;/a&gt; we got a call from Robert. He&#x2019;s 25 years old and feels pretty pessimistic about the future these days. So on this week&#x2019;s show we try to give Robert some reasons to hope. (Or, failing that, some sense that the left, the country, and the planet are not irrevocably doomed in the age of Trump.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up: Dan Savage and Sydney Brownstone, who talk about how to snatch optimism from the jaws of despondency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next: Zach Silk, a liberal political operative who really, truly believes the left has a chance to make big political gains under a Trump presidency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally: Rich Smith talks to me about my current hope against hope, which is that the Electoral College will save us on December 19th. Come on, Electoral College! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAGITTARIUS (Nov 22&#x2013;Dec 21): &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;The awesome splendor of the universe is much easier to deal with if you think of it as a series of small chunks,&quot; wrote novelist Terry Pratchett. That&#39;s true enough, but I&#39;ll add a caveat: Now and then the trickle of small chunks of awesome splendor gives way to a surge of really big chunks. According to my astrological analysis, that&#39;s either already happening for you or is about to happen. Can you handle it? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed that some people are unskilled at welcoming such glory; they prefer to keep their lives tidy and tiny. They may even get stressed out by their good fortune. I trust you&#39;re not one of these fainthearted souls. I hope you will summon the grace you&#39;ll need to make spirited use of the onslaught of magnificence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter&quot; style=&quot;width:500px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/binary/63b4/1456251497-shutterstock_374447992.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;You there, the tomato with the sexy gams.&quot; title=&quot;You there, the tomato with the sexy gams.&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;320&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption-and-credit&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;imageCredit&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-2083364p1.html?cr=00&amp;pl=edit-00&quot;&gt;Andrew Cline&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shutterstock.com/editorial?cr=00&amp;pl=edit-00&quot;&gt;Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers in Ohio have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/emaoconnor/ohio-passes-law-that-bans-abortion-after-a-month-and-a-half?utm_term=.kwy5m21j0l#.krDYkZ23EV&quot;&gt;passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would ban abortions upon the detection of a fetal heartbeat, which usually occurs about six weeks into a pregnancy. The measure was tacked onto an unrelated bill regarding the reporting of child abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate President Keith Faber pointed directly to Donald Trump and his anti-choice comments as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/07/empowered-by-trump-ohio-legislature-pass-heartbeat-bill-that-would-ban-most-abortions/?utm_term=.de9629e4639a&lt;br /&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/07/empowered-by-trump-ohio-legislature-pass-heartbeat-bill-that-would-ban-most-abortions/?utm_term=.de9629e4639a&quot;&gt;impetus for the bill&lt;/a&gt;, confirming fears that many women have had since the election last month that their access to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/11/16/24693320/heres-whats-going-to-happen-to-your-healthcare&quot;&gt;abortion, family planning, and healthcare services&lt;/a&gt; would diminish under the new administration.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Faber told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/07/politics/ohio-abortion-bill/&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;So what made the legislature&#39;s Republican majority move now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;One, a new President, new Supreme Court justice appointees change the dynamic, and that there was a consensus in our caucus to move forward,&quot; Ohio Senate President Keith Faber, a Republican from Celina, told reporters after the final vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked if he thought the bill would survive a legal challenge, he said: &quot;I think it has a better chance than it did before.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio Governor John Kasich, who has signed about &lt;a href=&quot;http://jezebel.com/ohio-is-trying-to-push-through-two-abortion-restriction-1789746958&quot;&gt;numerous anti-abortion measures&lt;/a&gt; into law during his time in office, has 10 days to sign or veto this bill. If he does nothing, this so-called &quot;Heartbeat Bill&quot;, the harshest abortion restriction in the nation, will become law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Guttmacher Institute, several states have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/overview-abortion-laws&quot;&gt;ban after 20 weeks&lt;/a&gt;, but most make exceptions in cases of rape or incest&#x2014;a mercy the Ohio bill does not allow for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Protest in front of Governor&#39;s mansion against &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Heartbeat?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Heartbeat&lt;/a&gt; Bill. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nbc4i&quot;&gt;@nbc4i&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/GWCusXVPJr&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/GWCusXVPJr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x2014; Courtney Yuen (@courtyuen) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/courtyuen/status/806295510298533892&quot;&gt;December 7, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union calls the measure unconstitutional and says they will fight the &quot;Heartbeat Bill&quot; in court if it becomes law. (This is a good time to remind you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://action.aclu.org/donate-aclu?ms=web_horiz_nav_hp&quot;&gt;donate to the ACLU&lt;/a&gt;.

This iteration features writer and translator Randa Jarrar and poet and writer Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha. &lt;i&gt;Dirty River: A Queer Femme of Color Dreaming Her Way Home&lt;/i&gt; earned Piepzna-Samarasinha an American Library Association Stonewall Award and a finalist nod from Lambda. The poems are pretty straightforward lyrical performance pieces about the daily inequities, triumphs, and loves of a &quot;queer disabled femme of color writer.&quot; In October, the independent but generally very good Saraband Books published Jarrar&#39;s collection of stories, &lt;i&gt;Him, Me, Muhammad Ali&lt;/i&gt;, which uses humor and a fabulist touch to reveal the diversity and complexity of modern Arabic life. &lt;b&gt;RICH SMITH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/Locations/24072562/hugo-house-first-hill&quot;&gt;Hugo House First Hill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were sitting in his green Toyota Camry after he snuck over at midnight and handed me a mix CD complete with album art and cute little liner notes with inside jokes. It was half songs to introduce me to his diverse (Tool) music (Tool) tastes (Tool) and half &quot;Wonderwall.&quot; Standard high-school mixtape. We popped it in and scooted to the backseat to get busy. Then, of course, &quot;People Are Strange&quot; came on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the first Wednesday of the month, which means the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestranger.com/events/18636257/silent-reading-party&quot;&gt;silent-reading party&lt;/a&gt; is tonight. In a shifting, sliding world, at least we still have the reading party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/the-reading-party/Content?oid=3845017&quot;&gt;what it&#39;s like at the reading party&lt;/a&gt;, right? You&#39;ve heard &lt;a href=&quot;http://knkx.org/post/heres-what-wed-bring-silent-reading-party-how-about-you&quot;&gt;this radio segment&lt;/a&gt; about the silent-reading party, right?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On piano tonight: &lt;strong&gt;Paul Matthew Moore&lt;/strong&gt; from 6 pm to 8 pm. The rest of us will sit there and read whatever we feel like reading (silently, to ourselves), while Paul plays piano and waiters bring us things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m reading &lt;em&gt;10:04&lt;/em&gt; by Ben Lerner. And you? What are you reading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestranger.com/events/18636257/silent-reading-party&quot;&gt;The reading party happens here&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;s all ages, and it&#39;s free.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogImageCenter img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media1.fdncms.com/stranger/imager/u/large/24734416/1481142671-savage-letter-of-the-day-stamp-2017.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SAVAGE-Letter-of-the-Day-STAMP-2017.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am having an issue with my boyfriend and I really don&#39;t know if I am the crazy, paranoid, controlling party or if I am legitimately upset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend and I have been together for more than a year and a half and have lived together for 5 months. Early on in our relationship, he and I had some troubles because he has an extremely low sex drive. I had a hard time not taking it personally (still do) and it made me very insecure. I think that&#39;s why, at the time, I became extremely jealous of his friendship with his very attractive intern. I&#39;d notice them texting pretty often, he&#39;d take her on &quot;photo-walks&quot; (he&#39;s a photographer) to practice her photography, and they&#39;d regularly get lunch together at work. Regardless, I have fully owned up to my irrational jealousy, and decided on my own that it was my responsibility to overcome that. Besides, she eventually stopped working with him, so they haven&#39;t really been in contact in over sex months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to the present day. On Monday night while we were having dinner, I asked my boyfriend what his plans were on Tuesday (I am currently studying for law school exams so I knew I wouldn&#39;t have time to spend with him). He told me he didn&#39;t know. Then on Tuesday, I was going to go to the store to get something to cook for dinner, so I checked in with him to see if he was planning to have his own dinner. He told me he wanted to do his own thing, which was great for me because it makes me happy when he takes time for himself, and I needed to focus on studying. Around 8:30, he texted me and asked me how my day of studying was going, and I asked him what his plans were for the evening. He told me he was going to meet an &quot;old coworker&quot; at a bar for birthday drinks. I didn&#39;t think twice about it and I moved on. I spent the next three hours studying, not thinking about it, and around 11:30 when I got in bed to relax, I saw on my Instagram feed that his old intern posted a photo of her birthday at the bar. I became extremely upset, because instead of being upfront and saying he was meeting HER for her birthday, he was intentionally ambiguous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t speculation. I confronted him about it when he got home and it admitted that he was ambiguous because he knew I&#39;d become concerned and wanted to avoid a freak out. I told him that if he&#39;d been upfront with me, I would have been jealous, but I would have also been mindful of my toxic feelings and not projected them onto him. I told him that as a result of how he handled it, I now feel worse, I feel lied to, and I feel insecure. He acted like I was being ridiculous, but I really do feel hurt. He insisted it was a last minute invite and he didn&#39;t want to cause any drama. We went to sleep and I woke up feeling refreshed and pretty much over it, but when he got into the shower I looked at his phone and saw that she had actually invited him on Monday afternoon. So he lied to me when I asked him what his plans were on Tuesday, and he lied to me again when he said it was a last minute invite. He was willfully ambiguous, and had every intention of hiding it from me. I am not upset with him for getting drinks with her&#x2014;most of his friends are female and I NEVER feel jealous. I have a weird tic about this girl, but I recognize it and I own up to it. I don&#39;t want to control him. But I feel lied to, I feel like I can&#39;t trust him now and I feel like seeing her last night was SO important to him, he was willing to be dishonest with me to make it happen. Up until now, I&#39;ve never once suspected him of being dishonest with me. He is one of the most honest people I know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I Crazy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex months? Interesting typo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s another way to read your boyfriend&#39;s ambiguity/obfuscation about his Tuesday night plans: being ambiguous/obfuscating was equal parts considerate and self-serving of him. Your boyfriend knew you had to study on Tuesday night, he knew his ex-intern is a sore subject and a distraction, and his being ambiguous allowed you to focus on your studies. Which you needed to do, right? So that was &lt;em&gt;maybekindasorta&lt;/em&gt; considerate of him, no? And since one person&#39;s &quot;mindful of my toxic feelings&quot; and &quot;handling it&quot; is another person&#39;s &quot;freak out&quot; and &quot;invasion of privacy,&quot; AIC, your boyfriend opted for ambiguousness/deceit-by-omission to spare himself the drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to demonstrate to your boyfriend that there&#39;s no reason for him to lie about spending time with his ex-intern in the future? Retroactively give your blessing to Tuesday night&#39;s birthday drinks and stop raking him over the fucking coals for his thoroughly explicable actions. (Actions so explicable I just explicked them.) Yes, he lied to you. But unless you&#39;re made of purity and light, AIC, you&#39;ve lied to him once or twice over the last year and half. Even the &quot;most honest&quot; people on earth are capable of telling the occasional harmless, white, self-serving lie. Want your relationship to survive? You roll your eyes at the odd HWSS lie, you forgive, and you move on. Want your relationship to end? Well... you do what you&#39;re doing, AIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless your boyfriend has given you some other reason(s) to believe he might be cheating on you with his ex-intern or some other woman/women, AIC, you should drop the whole Tuesday night/birthday drinks subject. You should also apologize to your boyfriend for having &quot;looked in his phone&quot; while he was in the shower, which is an asshole move, and you should stop following his triggering ex-intern on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
